# CAM2_git_qa

This is the QA testing for git training.
Task 1 - clone this repository.
Task 2 - create a branch. 
Task 3 - create a main.c file and write a code to sort an array. no user input is required (just have a fixed array and sort it and print the output)
Task 4 - push the code and make a pr. 
Task 5 - look as another pr (by the other coder) and give your reviews.
